# Sign-Language-Classifier

### This classifier can classify 24 different hand gestures representing Alphabets from A-Z.

**The dataset used in this project is from *Kaggle*. You get dataset from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist/download)**

**Stack of libraries used in this project-**
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* TensorFlow

Below figure show all gestures which represent A-Z alphabets, but 2 of these gesture need movements so it can't be classified from an image.

As you can see from above image J and Z needs movements so they can't be classified from an image. The Gestures which can be classified are shown in below figure.

*I have also attached labels for test set which are predicted by my model. It is 95% accurate. If you can improve accuracy you are welcome to contribute here.*
